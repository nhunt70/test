### **NOTE:** The problem statement for this project is defined below. All of the parts are accessible from one Jupyter notebook in this repository which is **`Human_Resources_Project.ipynb`**

Parts 1 and 2 utilize Python and involve data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and visualization. 
Part 3 is the dashboard created with Tableau, accessible from the URL in the Jupyter notebook.
Part 4 is the presentation, accessible from **`Human_Resources_Presentation.pdf`**.

**For Part 4: GitHub does not provide previews of PDF files therefore they must be downloaded and viewed on your local device.**

This project uses a simulated real-world HR dataset (generated using Python with the Faker library), accessible from **`HumanResources.csv`**.
All project resources including the dirty dataset, dashboard graphics, and simulated HR data generator are accessible from `Human_Resources_archive.zip`.

# **Problem Statement: Employee HR Data Analysis for Effective Workforce Management**

**Background:** In today's competitive business environment, effective human resource management is essential for enhancing productivity and retaining talent. The dataset provided simulates a robust human resources system containing demographic, job-related, and performance information for 6,820 employees across various departments and locations. Given the importance of strategic workforce planning, it is imperative to gain insightful interpretations from this data to guide managerial decisions in hiring, development, and retention efforts.

**Objectives:**

1. **Overview Analysis:**

* Calculate and visualize the total number of hired, active, and terminated employees.
* Analyze trends in hiring and termination rates over the years.
* Provide a breakdown of employees by department and job titles.
* Compare the distribution of employees between headquarters (Florida) and branch offices.
* Visualize the distribution of employees by city and state.

2. **Demographics Analysis:**

* Assess the gender ratio within the company.
* Analyze the age distribution of employees segmented by age groups.
* Evaluate the distribution of employees based on education levels.
* Investigate the correlation between educational backgrounds and performance ratings.

3. **Income Analysis**:

* Compare salaries across different educational levels, segmented by gender, to identify any discrepancies.
* Explore how age correlates with salary across various departments.
* Build a comprehensive employee list that includes essential information such as name, department, position, gender, age, education, and salary, with the ability to apply filters for detailed analysis.

**Expected Outcome:** By the end of this analysis, organizations will:

* Implement strategic initiatives aimed at improving retention, with the goal of reducing turnover by at least 10% over the next year.
* Enhance overall employee performance ratings, aiming for an increase in "Excellent" ratings by at least 15%.
* Identify potential discrepancies in salary based on education and gender, enabling targeted interventions to promote equity.
* Acquire a clear understanding of their current workforce composition and dynamics in order to make data-driven decisions that enhance workforce management.

**Data Sources:**

* The dataset includes the following attributes: Employee ID, First Name, Last Name, Gender, State, City, Education Level, Birthdate, Hire Date, Term Date, Department, Job Title, Salary, and Performance Rating. 
* This dataset serves as the primary source for all analyses and visualizations described in the objectives.
